<div class=about-me>
  My name is Ibrahim Kabia and Iâ€™m a 17 year old senior who wants to major in computer science. There are just  so many amazing things to learn and explore in this industry that leaves me learning something new everytime I open my computer. I want to continue to grow and learn, so I can be very well rounded when it comes to doing anything with computer science. With the way technology is growing there will be plenty of changes in the way we think and the actions we take. I want to be able to make innovations that change the way we think in our society, which is all  possible by using computer science to help achieve that.
